## What is an Active Component:

---

[Short]
An active component is a device that relies on an external power source 
to control or modify a signal.

[Long]
Examples include amplifiers, transistors, and LED's just to name a few.

## What is Attenuation:

---

[Short]
Attenuation is defined as the reduction in power of an RF signal. When it 
is unintentional, it is generally referred to as loss.

[Long]
RF attenuation can occur due to many factors such as resistance, distance, 
interference or material absorption.  It is measured in decibels; It is a 
ratio of the input power to the output power.

## What is Coupling Ratio:

---

[Short] Also known as Coupling Coefficient

[Long]

## What is a Decibel:

---

[Short]
A decibel is a logarithmic unit representing the relative difference between 
two quantities.

[Long]
Decibels can be represented in many different ways; dB, dBA, dBV, and dBm just 
to name a few. This is because, by definition, a decibel needs two quantities. 
The first quantity generally represents the value of interest and the second 
quantity is the reference value.

The third letter of the unit generally represents this reference value. 
Take dBV for instance; dBV represents a voltage value in decibels relative to 
a 1 V(rms) signal (1 V(rms) = 0 dBV). Similarly, dBm represents a power value 
relative to 1 mW (1 mW = 0 dBm). The most common units in the RF world are dB, 
dBm and dBc.

## What is Gain:

---

[Short]
Gain is defined as the increase in power of an RF signal.

[Long]
It is measured in decibels; It is a ratio of the output power to the input power.

## What is Group Delay:

---

[Short]
TBD

[Long]
TBD

## What is Group Delay:

---

[Short]
Jitter is any deviation in, or displacement of a signal. The deviation can be in 
terms of amplitude, phase timing or the width of the signal pulse.

[Long]
Deterministic vs Indeterministic

## What is Intermediate Frequency (IF):

## What is a Passive Component:

---

[Short]
A passive component is a device that can manipulate the existing energy in a circuit.

[Long]
They do not generate energy or rely on an external power source. Examples include 
resistors, capacitors, transformers, and diodes just to name a few.

## What is Phase Noise

---

[Short]
Phase noise is the frequency-domain representation of random fluctuations in 
the phase of a waveform.
