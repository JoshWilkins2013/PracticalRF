# What is an RF Mixer

---

Mixers are RF components whose main function is to multiply two signals. This multiplication
results in a frequency shift.

## Ports

---

A mixer has 3 ports; The RF port (for the signal of interest), the LO port (for the Local Oscillator),
and the IF port (for the Intermediate Frequency). The LO port is an input and it drives the mixer. The RF
and IF ports are bi-directional, but need to be opposite in direction.

## Up-Conversion

---

A mixer that converts a signal from a lower frequency to a higher frequency is called an up-converter.

An up-converter is generally used at the front-end of a *transmitter* and is usually followed by an amplifier. When
these are packaged together, it is called a *Block Up-Converter (BUC)*.

## Down-Conversion

---

Reciprocally, a mixer that converts a signal from a higher frequency to a lower frequency is called a *down-converter*.
When the LO frequency < the RF frequency, this is called *low-side injection* and the mixer is a *low-side
downconverter*. When the LO frequency > the RF frequency, this is called *high-side injection* and the mixer is a
*high-side downconverter*.

A down-converter is generally used at the front-end of a *receiver* and is followed by an amplifier. When these
components are packaged together, it is called a *Low Noise Block Converter (LNB)*.

## Uses

---

- Frequency Translation

The most obvious usage of a mixer is to change (or translate) the frequency of a signal.

Some less obvious uses of a mixer include
- Phase Detection
- Demodulation

## Properties

---

The important qualities of a mixer include:

- Operating Frequency Range
- Conversion Gain or Loss - lowers the noise impact of following stages.
- Intercept Point (Linearity) - impacts receiver blocking and interferer performance.
- Ports Isolation (LO-to-RF, LO-to-IF, RF-to-IF) - want to minimize interaction between the RF, IF, and LO ports.
- Noise Figure - impacts receiver sensitivity.
- High-order spurious response rejection.
- Image Noise suppression â€“ improves system noise figure.


## Types

---

- Unbalanced: Simply mixes two signals together; The output contains all of inter-modulation products as well as
some leakage of the original signals.

- Balanced: Contains a *balun(s)* or balancing circuit(s). Isolates the LO port from the RF port to reduce the
level of inter-modulation products.
