# What is an RF Mixer

---

RF mixers are generally *passive components* whose main function combine
two signals.

## Ports

---

- RF:   This is the input used for the signal whose frequency is to be changed. It is typically the incoming signal or equivalent and it is normally at a relatively low level compered to the other input.
- LO:   This is for the local oscillator signal. The signal input level for this port is generally much larger than that for the RF input.
- IF:   This is the output port for the mixer. It is the port where the "mixed" signal appears.

## Properties

Important properties of an RF Mixer are:
- Conversion Gain or Loss - lowers the noise impact of following stages.
- Intercept Point (Linearity) - impacts receiver blocking and interferer performance.
- Ports Isolation (LO-to-RF, LO-to-IF, RF-to-IF) - want to minimize interaction
between the RF, IF, and LO ports.
- Noise Figure - impacts receiver sensitivity.
- High-order spurious response rejection.
- Image Noise suppression â€“ improves system noise figure.
- Operating Frequency Range

## Types

- Unbalanced
- Single balanced
- Double balanced
- Triple balanced
