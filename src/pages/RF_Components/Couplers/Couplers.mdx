# What is an RF Coupler

---

An RF coupler is a *passive component* that essentially siphons part of
a signal off to another path. The *through path* is ideally unaffected, but
has some loss.

# Basic Coupler

---

The relative amount that is siphoned to the coupled path is called the
*coupling ratio* or *coupling coefficient*. This ratio is a controlled
parameter in the creation of a coupler and dependent on system requirements.

- Directional couplers sample signal from the main line in forward direction
- Bi-directional couplers have two coupled ports to sample signal from the forward
or reflected signal paths as needed
- Dual directional couplers allow simulataneous sampling of both thru- and reflected
signal power.

Couplers are widely used in RF systems for a variety of functions
including power monitoring, antenna reflection monitoring,
automated gain control, and electrical test and measurement among many others.
